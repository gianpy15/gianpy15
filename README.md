# <div align="center"> Hi there üëã </div>

I‚Äôm Gianpaolo, an engineer, gamer and passionate about technology and innovation. I specialized in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and NLP to better understand the technologies that will dominate all markets in the near future. I found my StartUp Neuraly with the mission to bring these technologies to the smallest companies in Italy. I'm currently looking for a full-time job in Machine Learning Engineer or Software Engineer.

### üéì Education
* M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano **110 cum Laude** (highest evaluation) with focus in **Machine Learning**, Data Science, **Computer Vision**, Software Engineering.
* B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano with focus on **Statistics**, differential calculus, theoretical computer science.

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Working Experience
* **Neuraly** | Founder and CTO, Software Engineer, ML Engineer, Italy
  * Launched an AI startup focused in building and delivering NLP and Computer Vision solutions through SotA architectures.
  * Helped **4+ companies** to improve their products by delivering 7+ SotA NLP and Computer Vision products.
  * Trained and deployed Neural Network pipelines with **1k+downloads** monthly. [SentiBert](https://huggingface.co/neuraly/bert-base-italian-cased-sentiment).
* **GoBee.it** | Freelance, ML Engineer, Italy
  * Collaborated with the StaUp Gobee for the creation of shooting maps to record and edit video automatically.
  * Improved automatic video capturing with **90% accuracy** by training a Computer Vision model.
* **Politecnico di Milano** | Teacher, Software Developer, Italy
  * I taught as laboratory tutor for some courses in computer science about programming helping students in writing and compiling C programs on Linux environment.

### üíª Main Projects
* Neuraly - NLP & NLU Intelligence Platform
  * Created a platform (SaaS) that ingests unstructured data (i.e. PDFs, OSINT) through a RESTful API for an in-depth analysis.
  * Implemented **15+ modules** to extract Keywords, Entities, OCR, Topics, Knowledge-Graph, Summary and Sentiment.
  * Improved scalability supporting **10K+ documents** per user using cloud technologies and implementing a semantic document search engine with advanced Intelligence features.
* Neuraly - Open Source Sentiment Analysis Transformer
  * We Released the first Italian Sentiment Analysis Model on the HuggingFace platform with **1k+ monthly downloads**. We achieved SotA performances in Sentiment analysis with **82% accuracy** on the test set.
  * [`SentiBERT Model`](https://huggingface.co/neuraly/bert-base-italian-cased-sentiment)
* Neuraly - Computer Vision for Anti tampering
  * Created an iOS app for a customer that can read a qr and a hologram from a tag.
  * reated an algorithm to decode a code present in the hologram, make a matching with the qr and verify through an ML model that the hologram is real and not counterfeit.
  * Created a model for classify images of holograms (real/fake) with **85% accuracy**
* Thesis - Towards Affordance Prediction with Vision via Task Oriented Grasp Quality Metrics
  * Defined a theoretical framework for task-oriented grasp evaluation, synthesized robotic grasping data on objects through a c++ grasp simulator and trained GraphNet on synthetic data achieving **87% accuracy**.
  * This work as part of the MSc thesis led to a publication (in press) at a relevant workshop within the ICRA conference.
  * [`Paper`](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04761)
  * [`IWCMAR Conference`](https://r1d1.github.io/iwcmar/)
